# HtmlProject bundle
This is just a simple bundle with some helpers for managing HTML projects.

# Create Project Skeleton
Creates an html project skeleton with:

* an index.html file with skeleton html
* a javascript folder 
	* an empty behaviors.js file
* a css folder
	* an empty master.css file
	
# Issues
Unfortunately, TextMate bundles require that you select a file before they can be used. You can create a dummy file and select that file before attempting to use the HtmlProject bundle.
